            <h1>Brief Description</h1>
            <p>    </p>

            <h2>Who started this?</h2>
            <p>   </p>

            <h2>Why does this exist</h2>
            <p>   </p>

            <h2>Four interesting facts</h2>
            <p>Software Duplication is a gateway for more bugs </p>

            <p>Maintaing the software is much harder</p>

            <p>Software duplication is used because of lazyness</p>

            <p>Another word for Software Duplication is Code cloning</p>

            <h2>Examples of this from History</h2>
            <p> One example is making more copies of software than the license allows in other words, plagiarizing.
                    Another example is if somebody doesn't want to learn the language they clone the code.</p>

            <h2>How does this affect coding or online culture?</h2>
             <p>This affects the online culture by creating bad habits for users instead of actually learning to code it.
                    It'll also affects the software itself making it more difficult to function and run. Most people are persuaded
                    into doing it because of the benefits it offers but don't know the risks.</p>
