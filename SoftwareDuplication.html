            <h1>Software Duplication</h1>
           
            <h2>Brief Description</h2>
            <p>Software Duplication is simply when a creator wants to copy and paste code or software so they can share it. </p>
            <p>However there is also Software Piracy which is the major disadvantage when someone illegally copies and distributes software or the source code.</p>
            <p>This "business" has caught the attention of many crime groups in a number of countries. The Business Software  </p>
            <p>Alliance (BSA), reports that about 36% of all software in current use is stolen. Software Duplication is sadly </p>
            <p>common but has caused significant loss in revenue for publishers because they are not getting the money or     </p>
            <p>credit they deserve which in turn results in higher prices for the cosnumer.</p>

            <h2>Who started this?</h2>
            <p>Copy and Pasting code has been a tool ever since it was created. However one of the disadvantages is Software Piracy.</p>
            <p>Before 1980 one could freely copy computer programs and pirate without any leagal ramifications. If someone    </p>
            <p>wanted to and people did, they could just freely go and copy any source code and mass spread it for free or for</p>
            <p>their own money and personal gain. So Software duplication started as a popluation and not by one singular person.</p>

            <h2>Why does this exist</h2>
            <p>Software Duplication is such a simple tool to use because it saves time and makes typing out code faster and easier.</p>
            <p>On the other hand Software piracy Exists and a major reason is because some software may cost money and some people dont want </p>
            <p>to pay for it. One other reason is so another person gets paid and not the creator. The person could copy the  </p>
            <p>code and sell the same software they didnt make so they get the money and not the person who made it.</p>

            <h2>Four interesting facts</h2>
            <p>Software Duplication is a gateway for more bugs </p>

            <p>Maintaing the software is much harder</p>

            <p>Software duplication is used because of lazyness</p>

            <p>Another word for Software Duplication is Code cloning</p>

            <h2>Examples of this from History</h2>
            <p>One example is making more copies of software than the license allows in other words, plagiarizing.</p>
            <p> Another example is if somebody doesn't want to learn the language they clone the code.</p>

            <h2>How does this affect coding or online culture?</h2>
            <p>This affects the online culture by creating bad habits for users instead of actually learning to code it.</p>
            <p> It'll also affects the software itself making it more difficult to function and run. Most people are persuaded</p>
            <p>into doing it because of the benefits it offers but don't know the risks.</p>
