            <h1>Software Duplication</h1>
           
            <h2>Brief Description</h2>
            <p>Software Duplication or Software Piracy is when someone illegally copies and distributes software such as code.</p>
            <p>This "business" has caught the attention of many crime groups in a number of countries. The Business Software  </p>
            <p>Alliance (BSA), reports that about 36% of all software in current use is stolen. Software Duplication is sadly </p>
            <p>common but has caused significant loss in revenue for publishers because they are not getting the money or     </p>
            <p>credit they deserve which in turn results in higher prices for the cosnumer.</p>

            <h2>Who started this?</h2>
            <p>Before 1980 one could freely copy computer programs and pirate without any leagal ramifications. If someone    </p>
            <p>wanted to and people did, they could just freely go and copy any source code and mass spread it for free or for</p>
            <p>their own money and personal gain. So Software duplication started as a popluation and not by one singular person.</p>

            <h2>Why does this exist</h2>
            <p>One major reason Software duplication Exists is because some software may cost money and some people dont want </p>
            <p>to pay for it. One other reason is so another person gets paid and not the creator. The person could copy the  </p>
            <p>code and sell the same software they didnt make so they get the money and not the person who made it.</p>
